                    <p style="color:#F9F3EE" class="mt-2 fs-5">Hackers have used ransomware to take the website of Ukraine's energy ministry offline and encrypt its files.

The website currently contains a message written in English, demanding a ransom of 0.1 bitcoin - worth $927.86 (£664.98) by today's exchange rate.
Ukranian cyber-police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko said the attack is an "isolated incident" and no other government websites have been affected.
She added that the energy ministry's email system was still up and running.
"This case is not large-scale. If necessary, we are ready to react and help," said Ms Kvitko.
"Our specialists are working right now... We do not know how long it will take to resolve the issue."

                        stores were unintentionally used for cryptocurrency-mining. Apparently, the WiFi network on the affected sites was modified
                        to embed a CoinHive miner on pages loaded via the in-store WiFi. Thanks to this modification, the devices of users who connected
                        to the network were used to mine the Monero cryptocurrency without their knowledge.

                        This exposure impacted 92% of the total LinkedIn user base of 756 million users.
                        The data was dumped in two waves, initially exposing 500 million users, and then a second dump where the hacker "God User" boasted that
                        they were selling a database of 700 million LinkedIn.

                    <p style="color:#F9F3EE" class="mt-2 fs-5">One of the largest verifiable DDoS attacks on record targeted GitHub,
                        a popular online code management service used by millions of developers. This attack reached 1.3 Tbps,
                        sending packets at a rate of 126.9 million per second. The GitHub attack was a memcached DDoS attack, so there were no botnets involved.
                        Instead the attackers leveraged the amplification effect of a popular database caching system known as memcached.
                        By flooding memcached servers with spoofed requests, the attackers were able to amplify their attack by a magnitude of about 50,000x.
                        Luckily, GitHub was using a DDoS protection service, which was automatically alerted within 10 minutes of the start of the attack.
                        This alert triggered the process of mitigation and GitHub was able to stop the attack quickly.
                        The massive DDoS attack only ended up lasting about 20 minutes.

                    <p style="color:#F9F3EE" class="mt-2 fs-5"> A Lithuanian hacker Evaldas Rimasauskas fleeced Google and Facebook for more than $120 million.
                    The hacker created a scheme where he used spear phishing to lure money out of these companies. The acquired funds were then transferred through Cyprus
                        and Latvia and later funneled into bank accounts around the world. The perpetrator used an elaborate spear-phishing scam to carry out this
                        scheme. He sent emails to Google and Facebook employees disguised as an Asian-based computer hardware company (Company-1).
                        It worked like a charm. As you may have already guessed from the fact that we know the perpetrator’s name – he was caught.
                        Evaldas was sentenced to 60 months after his partially successful phishing scam.
